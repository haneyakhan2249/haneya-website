                <b>IBM Extreme Blue Intern (2018)</b>
                <br/>
                At IBM, I designed and developed a visualization application that extracts data from collaboration tools to show how people work. I led <a>DevOps engineering</a> within the team and worked on <a>data ingestion and extraction</a> problems. From start to finish, this project included user interviews and mockups for product design, data ingestion and integration, data visualization, managing continuous integration and deployment, and finally, a product pitch!

                <b>Technologies I worked with:</b> <a>Python, React, Docker, Travis CI, Kubernetes, etc</a>.

                <b style={{color: 'black'}}>Oracle Cloud Development Co-op (2017)</b>
                <br/> 
                At Oracle, I <a>designed, developed, and supported multiple cloud environments</a>. This included everything from setting up physical servers to <a>automating cloud provisioning and deployment</a>, and finally, to adding enhancements based on customers changing requirements.

                <br/>
                Since my freshman year, I have done research in a lab where I have worked on <a>cybersecurity, website fingerprinting, and data analytics projects</a>. In doing so, I utilized a variety of <a>data mining and machine learning techniques and libraries</a>. I also <a>wrote and presented a paper</a> at the UTD CS Research Expo <a>on Closed World Website Fingerprinting </a>(a mechanism to identify encrypted traffic using machine learning techniques).
